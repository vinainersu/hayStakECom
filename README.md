# hayStakECom

This project is built for iOS using UIKit. The core functionalities implemented as per the assignment requirements include:

Item Interaction: Clicking an item displays a preview with its image, name, and description.
 Cart Functionality:
Clicking the heart icon adds or removes the item from the cart.
A cart icon in the tab bar reflects the number of items in the cart.
Cart Display: All cart items are displayed in a list format.
Checkout Action: Clicking the checkout button displays a "Thank You" popup message.
Given Heart interaction in HomeController and DetailsViewController

My Approach & Scope
The increment and decrement of cart items were not included, as the requirement only mentioned adding/removing items via the heart icon.
No additional user interactions or extra features were implemented, strictly following the given assignment instructions.
